## 🧠 Why YT Learn?

YouTube is a great platform for learning, but it’s crowded and unstructured. Learners often:

- Lose track of valuable videos
- Struggle to organize content by topic
- Get distracted by unrelated recommendations

**YT Learn** solves this by providing a clean, user-centered interface to **save, organize, and view** videos under custom learning topics.
